# RWKV Distributed Inference Server and Clients
Uses: https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM

## How To Use

Run the work server and assign work using the REST API(Documentation throughout code)

Run as many clients as desired, clients will collect batches of work from the work server and work on them, then return the results.

Each client has an associated README.

Very WIP/Proof of Concept/Take this and build what you really need off of it using this as a base kinda release.
